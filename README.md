MyGarageApp-React-App
Name : Ryan Pitts

React Project : General Assembly Software Engineering Immersive Program

Concept: The MyGarageApp allows a user to 'stay on top' of their auto's maintanence and scheduled check-ins. The app will allow a user to enter multiple vehicles to keep track of their maintanance history and future appointments. Schedule maintainence appointments for later in the future, edit current/past service appointments,etc
