DIY Mechanic App

Concept: The DIY Mechanic App allows a user to 'stay on top' of their auto's maintenance and scheduled check-ins. Schedule maintenance appointments for later in the future, edit current/past service appointments,etc

Technologies used: 
React / Redux
Express
Node.js
Mongodb - cloud based server
JWT Authorization

The app is connected to the MongoDB cloud server.  Information about items and users are stored in its own cluster.

To start the app you can use : npm run dev - This will run the server.js and react app at the same time using the concurrently package

DIY Mechanic v1.0

Ability to login/register/logout user.  User credentials are secured using Bcrypt and JWT authorization.

User can create service reminder for vehicle.  This allows for adding and deleting of the service information

Implemented Redux to store state 

Update November 2019 - Since I created this application I have expanded by knowledge of React/Redux and I'm going to create a DIY Mechanic v2.0 to show the progress that has been made in the last six months.
